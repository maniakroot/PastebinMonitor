#**Pastebin Monitor**
###Small app that fetches pastas'

* it can also filter them according to RegEx'es (to get for example account or phone numbers etc.),
* save into multiple formats including HTML, SQL, JSON, XML, CSV, DOCX etc.
* or just sits and grabs new ones and provides user with nice html tabular output with pagination and search bar
* uses Flask as web application backend and SQLite3 as database

In future it will try to guess source code using some kind of machine learning algorithm and classifier and
group pastas' according to its results.
